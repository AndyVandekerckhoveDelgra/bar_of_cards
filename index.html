            <h3>What is this site?</h3>
            <p><span>The Bar of Cards offers a replayable experience with Solitaire and their very own card game, Rare Brawl. Gather as many points as you can and collect all the 50 cards!</span></p>
            <h3>How to collect points?</h3>
            <p>
                <span>Points can be collected by winning a game of Solitaire or Rare Brawl.</span>
            </p>
            <h3>Rare Brawl:</h3>
            <h4>What to do before playing?</h4>
            <p>
                <span>Before you start a game of Rare Brawl, you must make a team of 3 cards. They are your brawlers for this game.</span>
            </p>
            <h4>Cards explained</h4>
            <p>
                <span>Each card has 1 type, 2 different stats, and 2 different attacks. The symbol on the top far right indicates the type of the brawler. The stat with a value next to "HP:" is the HP stat; the stat with a value next to "Speed:" is the speed stat. The other two values are for the attacks, which are accompanied by a symbol, which too should indicate the type, but for the attack instead of the card. The values for both attacks are also counted as stats and can be increased by the bonus from the Gift Phase.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="Card%20example.png" alt="Card Explanation" class="responsive">
            </p>
            <p><span>
                    The symbols for the attacks and types, and the values for the stats vary from cards. The same kind of symbols for attacks are also used for the type. This is because this card game works with a weakness system explained in "Weakness explained".</span>
            </p>
            <p><span><img src="Symbols%20with%20descrip.png" class="responsive" alt="Symbols" height="155" width="355"></span></p>
            <h4>How to play?</h4>
            <p>
                <span>The game starts with the first round. Each round is split in different phases that happen chronogically as listed: Send Phase, Gift Phase, Decision Phase, Attack Phase, and Last Phase. The only phases where you can interact with the game are the Send Phase, and the Decision Phase.
                </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>The round starts with the Send Phase. If the player has no brawler on his side of the field, they must send out a brawler; the player must choose which brawler in their team they will play. That brawler will stay on the field. If this is the first Send Phase of the game, usually both players must sent out a brawler. Once both player have sent out a brawler, there are 2 brawlers on the field: The one you own and your opponent's brawler.
                </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Subsequently the Gift Phase ensues; in which a "dice" gets rolled. The every stat of each brawler on the field gets increased by the result of the die roll.
                </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>After the Gift Phase, is the Decision Phase. In this phase the user can interact with the game; each player chooses one of the two attacks on their brawler to use. This attack will be used during the Attack Phase. The brawler with a higher Speed stat attacks first. As you can see on your brawler, each attack has a number as a value. When a brawler is attacked, their HP stat gets reduced by the number of the used attack. If that brawler's HP got reduced to 0 or less, that brawler get removed from the field and cannot be used again during this game; they are officially "defeated". After the first brawler attacked, the other brawler attacks. After the attacks, usually both brawlers should have less HP than they first had. All stat changes during the Attack Phase are permanent. After both brawlers have attacked, the round moves to the Last Phase. The bonus during the Gift Phase wears off during the Last Phase: Every Brawler's stats get reduced by the result of the die roll from the Gift Phase from the same round. After that, the round ends. The HP stat of a brawler can indeed get reduced to 0 or less during the Last Phase, which of course leads to that brawler getting defeated (Both brawlers get defeated simultaneously if the bonus wearing off, reduces both their HP to 0).
                </span>
            </p>
            <p><span>After a round ends, another round happens. All of this should normally continue happening until one player loses.</span></p>
            <h4>Weakness
                explained</h4>
            <p>
                <span>Each attack has a type assigned to it. Depending on the type brawler the attack is used on, the attack's value may increase (it does more "damage" to the opposing brawler), or decrease (do less "damage"). The amount that's used to increase or decrease the values with is always 2. For example if a paper type attack is used against a rock type brawler, the value gets increased by 2; but if it's used against a scissor type brawler, its value gets decreased by 2. These increases/decreases happen right after the attack is declared, but before the opposing brawler gets attacked. However these increases or decreases disappear during the Last Phase: The values of the adjusted attack's value gets increased/decreased by 2 to turn it back to its original value. There are only 3 types in this game. The following scheme shows how the types interact.</span>

            <h4>How to win?</h4>
            <p>
                <span>By defeating all of your opponent's brawlers.</span>
            </p>
            <h4>Where to get cards?</h4>
            <p>
                <span>You can buy cards in the "Card Shop" in the LOGIN page</span>
